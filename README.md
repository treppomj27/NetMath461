# The Probabilities Repository

### University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign <br/> NetMath 461 - Introduction to Probability Theory

I developed this Python repository as I took an online calculus-based probabilities course through the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign's NetMath program. I created this repository not only to implement and demonstrate the
concepts I was learning throughout the course but as a way to further my abilities in object-oriented Python
programming.
