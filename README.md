# My Probabilities Repository

### University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign <br/> NetMath 461 - Introduction to Probability Theory

I developed this Python repository as I took an online calculus-based probabilities course through the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign's NetMath program. Writing this code has not only helped me to implement and demonstrate
the concepts I was learning throughout the course but it has helped me further my abilities in object-oriented Python
programming.
